Nolla is the title for my second rapid ideation project for my MA in UX Design @ Falmouth University. It is also my first time creating a repository and trying to learn Git as a form of version control applied to UX.

The idea behind Nolla is a universal app that allows artists from all over the world to connect and submit artwork to festivals, curators, galleries, etc.
